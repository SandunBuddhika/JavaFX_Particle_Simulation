This JavaFX application simulates particles that are connected by lines. The user can customize the number of particles, the length and width of the connections, the radius of the particles, and the color of the particles, connections, and background. The application also allows the user to add blur and glow effects.

# Simulation customization

* Number of particles (from 10 to 2000)
* Connection max length (from 40 to 250)
* onnection line width (from 1 to 10)
* Particle radius (from 1 to 30)
* Whether to use random radius or a fixed radius
* Whether to use random connection color or a fixed connection color
* Particle color
* Connection color
* Background color
* Blur effect
* Glow effect
